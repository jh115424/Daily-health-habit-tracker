# React + Vite
🧠 Core Features to Practice
Storing and updating habits (array of objects)

Toggling a habit as complete/incomplete

Resetting habits daily using date logic

Optional: Save progress in localStorage

🛠️ Main Components
You can build this as a single file for now:

HabitTracker.jsx
Or separate these if you want structure:

HabitList.jsx (renders list)

HabitItem.jsx (one habit box)

App.jsx (manages state and date reset)
